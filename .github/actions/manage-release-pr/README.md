# 📋 Manage Release Pull Request GitHub Action

Finds or creates a PR from a source to target branch, checks mergeability, and performs a merge commit (preserving individual commit history).

---

## ✨ Overview

This action manages the entire lifecycle of a release pull request:
1. **Searches** for an existing PR with a deterministic title (for restart detection)
2. **Creates** a new PR if none exists
3. **Checks** if the PR can be automatically merged (no conflicts)
4. **Merges** the PR into the target branch (preserving individual commits and authors)

If the PR has merge conflicts, the action fails with a clear error message. The PR remains open so the user can resolve conflicts and restart the workflow.

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

- **PR Title Convention**: The PR title follows the pattern `Release <release-name>: Merge into <target-branch>`. This deterministic naming enables the action to find existing PRs on restart.
- **Mergeability Check**: GitHub may take a moment to compute mergeability after PR creation. The action retries up to 5 times with a 3-second delay.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If the PR has conflicts, resolve them manually on the source branch, then restart the workflow. The action will find the existing PR and retry the merge.
- **No Changes**: If the source branch has no commits ahead of the target branch (i.e., nothing to release), the action exits successfully with `pr-state=no-changes` instead of failing. No PR is created.
- **Already Merged**: If the PR is already merged (restart after successful merge), the action reports success and returns the existing merge SHA.
- **Merge Method**: The action uses a merge commit (not squash) to preserve individual commit history and author attribution on the main branch. Each release is marked by a merge commit.
- **GitHub Enterprise Support**: The action auto-detects the GitHub server hostname and works with GitHub Enterprise instances.
